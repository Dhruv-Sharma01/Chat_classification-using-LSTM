# Chat_classification-using-LSTM
Hello
This repository contains dataset and python code for classifying a chat message into a question, answer , general statement or admin side statement. This model has been trained on bilingual data of hindi and english language. 

Training data is in summer.csv
And model code is in sctf.py

Model has been able to achieve more than 90% accuracy by using lstm approach.
Other approches like CNN, XGBOOST were not this efficicient

Using the model

Initial model output will display accuracy of each epoch and then it will display final model accuracy

After this you will keep entering the statements which you want to be classified 

On typing 'exit' no further input will be taken and then the message classification will be displayed.

Thank You!
